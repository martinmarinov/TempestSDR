This is a driver for the FlexiTV™ MSi3101 SDR USB Dongle for Windows. You first need to install the SDR driver from http://www.mirics.com/

In order to compile the plugin:

	make all MIRICS_HOME=path_to_mirics_installation

On Windows 8 x64 this could look like

	make all MIRICS_HOME=C:/PROGRA~1/MiricsSDR

This plugin is only for Windows. Make sure the mir_sdr_api.dll is in the library path (or in the same directory as the executable).
You can find the dll in C:/Program Files/MiricsSDR/API/x86 or C:/Program Files/MiricsSDR/API/x64 depending on your architecture.
